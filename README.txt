This is a website for my Makkah Restaurant. Waiting to deploy it properly still as waiting for hosting options offered by the Government as part of their covid-19 relief

I mainly built this out of React to get some practise using it even though this could have easily been a static website. Used a combination of regular bootstrap along with React-Bootstrap which was surprisingly nicer to use if you read the documentation properly.  

Future addons:

- Contact/suggestions with mailchimp API
- About section
- Extensive menu with cards. This is the more ambitous part I'm most excited for. I want to showcase the whole menu with cards and pictures for each food. This is part of the reason I started with React for making this easier to implement in the future. I find people are more willing to try out ethnic foods if they know what they're buying without having to look it up too much
