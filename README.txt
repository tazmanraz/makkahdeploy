This is a website for my family's restaurant, Makkah Restaurant. It's deployed at at https://www.makkahrestaurant-toronto.com/ 

I am waiting for a better domain name offered by the Digital Main Street program by the Ontario government. 

I mainly built this out of React to get some practise using it even though this could have easily been a static website. Used a combination of regular bootstrap along with React-Bootstrap which was surprisingly nicer to use if you read the documentation properly. The order section of this website took advantage of React features and I plan to add more features on this site to take advantage of React.

Future addons:

- Contact/suggestions along with a newsletter signup section with mailchimp API
- About section with a little history of the business
- Scale order partners better for mobile devices
- Make featured dishes section styled cleaner
- Extensive menu with cards. This is the more ambitous part I'm most excited for. I want to showcase the whole menu with cards and pictures for each food. This is part of the reason I started with React for making this easier to implement in the future. I find people are more willing to try out ethnic foods if they know what they're buying without having to look it up too much
